README: JavaScript Code Challenges
This repository contains solutions to various JavaScript programming challenges designed to solve real-world problems. Each challenge is implemented as a standalone function, allowing for easy understanding, testing, and reuse.

Challenges Overview
1. Student Grade Calculator
This program calculates a student's grade based on input marks between 0 and 100.

Inputs: A number representing the student's marks.
Logic:
Marks above 79: Grade A
Marks between 60 and 79: Grade B
Marks between 50 and 59: Grade C
Marks between 40 and 49: Grade D
Marks below 40: Grade E
Output: The corresponding grade for the input marks.

2. Speed Limit and Demerit Points Checker
This program determines if a driver is within the speed limit and calculates demerit points for speeding.

Inputs: Speed of the car (in km/h).
Logic:
Speeds ≤ 70: "Ok"
For every 5 km/h above 70, add one demerit point.
If points exceed 12, display "License suspended".
Output: Either "Ok", the number of demerit points, or "License suspended".
